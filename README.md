# Housing_Price_Prediction
This project involves cleaning, exploring, modeling, and evaluating the housing price dataset for accurate prediction.

The steps used for the housing price prediction project are as follows:

1. **Data Import and Exploration**: 
   - Imported necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and visualization libraries.
   - Loaded the housing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values by imputing or dropping them.
   - Performed feature engineering, including encoding categorical features using methods like One-Hot Encoding.
   - Scaled numerical features for consistency in machine learning models.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generated visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand relationships between features.
   - Identified key factors affecting housing prices, including location, size, and other important variables.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets.
   - Trained Multiple Linear Regression model.
   - Tuned hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation to improve model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using performance metrics such as MAPE and R² (coefficient of determination).
   - Compared different models to select the best-performing one for predicting housing prices.

6. **Final Insights and Predictions**:
   - Used the best model to make predictions on the test data.
   - Generated final insights and discussed the key factors influencing housing prices based on the model's results.
